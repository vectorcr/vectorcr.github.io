            I decided to create a Jekyll blog to outline my journey through a
            programming skill reset. Over the last few months, I have been able to
            see gaps in my skillset due to being a self-taught developer. I hope
            that starting from 0 I will be able to become stronger as a developer by
            picking up on things that I overlooked on my first go around.

              A little about me. I am a self-taught 33-year-old developer currently
              living in Costa Rica. I have been messing around with code in some
              capacity since the age of nine. Back in the early days, I would find an
              issue that I would want to tackle and I would hone in on fixing the said
              issue. The problem with this is that I got into the habit of adopting
              tunnel vision. I would be so focused on the solution that I would often
              miss taking more in from the journey.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Now I am a bit older and wiser. I realize the effects that this has had
              on my approach to development and I would like to course-correct over
              the next two years. I realize that this is probably not the best way of
              going about this but this is the path I want to take.

              While blogging I will try to include as much information about projects
              that I am taking on and summarize the best I can what I learned at each
              step.
