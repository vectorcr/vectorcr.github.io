# Cleaning house w/ git(ssh method) / nvm / (Neo)vim / nnn / zsh / oh-my-zsh / powerlevel10k

I ran into some issues over the last 24 hours. In short, I had to move back to Fedora 33 following an issue with the `akmod-nvidia` package that was included in the Fedora34 repo. I attempted to patch using some fancy terminal fu but I was not able to get my external monitor properly working. Anywho I went through the setup process from the top and it was for the better. I managed to get back up and running fairly quickly and I was able to refine my process.

## GIT (ssh method)

Up to this point, I have been using the `HTTPS` method to clone my repositories in the terminal. By running `git clone https://xyz.etc.etc.etc` I would pull the repositories. But fumbling with the GIT credential manager timeout is a pain. I found that there is a timeout and while this timeout can be modified I feel that it’s better to learn the key generation and pairing process for GitHub. This is what I did.

- [Official GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

It's been a while since I last did this so I ran into some issues trying to authenticate after following the guide. I realized that when it was using the example of `git@github.com` I was meant to literally use `git@github.com` and not replace the `git` with my own GitHub username. After getting everything configured and validated I can now do GIT commands without needing to enter my username and password every x amount of seconds. 

## NVM
In the future, I will be working on JS project and eventually need node for something. I figured I would nip this in the bud and get it out of the way. I have worked with node in the past and have become pretty familiar with how to get it up and running. The NVM tool is my goto for getting different versions of node installed and running. 

The NVM install process for Fedora went as smoothly as I expected.

## Neovim 
Part of my goal is to use the terminal exclusively for development moving forward. When I am closer to my finish line I will go ahead and switch back over to visual studio code. For now, I am going to stick to using vim/nvim as much as possible.

I decided to use the following plugins for my config. Hopefully, some of these will be useful to anyone reading. While I enjoyed the look of the terminator I wanted to really just focus on one window at a time and making sure that my editor had everything I needed at a glance without having to leave the window.  Below is a list of the plugins that I am using for neovim. I do need to warn anyone that I ran into some issues with setting up COC due to NVM. After some digging, I found a closed ticket here that talks a bit about not being able to find the executable binary for NPM [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/bronul/q_how_to_properly_set_up_coctsserver_when_using/). 

### Plugins installed
* neoclide/coc.nvim // Make your Vim/Neovim as smart as VSCode. // [Project Link](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
* leafgarland/typescript-vim // Typescript Syntax for Vim // [Project Link](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim)
* peitalin/vim-jsx-typescript // Syntax highlighting and indentation for JSX in Typescript (typescriptreact filetypes) // [Project Link](https://github.com/peitalin/vim-jsx-typescript)
* preservim/nerdtree // The NERDTree is a file system explorer for the Vim editor. Using this plugin, users can visually browse complex directory hierarchies, quickly open files for reading or editing, and perform basic file system operations // [Project Link](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
* ryanoasis/vim-devicons // Adds filetype glyphs (icons) to various vim plugins // [Project Link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons)
* junegunn/fzf // fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. [Project Link](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* junegunn/fzf.vim // fzf in itself is not a Vim plugin, and the official repository only provides the basic wrapper function for Vim and it's up to the users to write their own Vim commands with it. However, I've learned that many users of fzf are not familiar with Vimscript and are looking for the "default" implementation of the features they can find in the alternative Vim plugins // [Project Link](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)

### End Result
After getting everything installed and somewhat configured I was able to get this result from the code editor! I am really happy with the way it came out. It’s functional and capable.  This gives me a great starting point for the tasks that are to come!

## NNN (N3)
In my journey to terminal zen, I thought about how inefficient it was to leave the terminal, go to files, find files etc. I figured that there needed to be something inside of the terminal that I could get my hands on that would help navigate and manage files. I came across [this project](https://github.com/jarun/nnn). I was able to easily install it running `sudo dnf install nnn`. I saw that in the screenshot provided on the project page that the example they used comes with icons. I will tackle getting that up and running in a future post.

I realized that I could press `ctrl-d` to get a more detailed look at the directories! One thing I especially enjoy is the fact that if I press enter on the file it will auto open with whichever associated application I set. For a future project, I want to make nvim the default editor for all text files.

## zhs + oh-my-zsh + p10k + nerdfonts + extras 
To wrap up this very long post I wanted to tackle making everything much nicer to look at. Since I am looking at a terminal all day I need to make things as comfortable as possible. I ran across [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and [Power level 10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). I have installing zsh and ohmyzsh down to a science so I won't backtrack. For the font families, I chose the following.

* [Jetbrains mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for the interface and document text 
* [SpaceMono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) for monospace and Legacy window titles

After configuring I was able to settle on a look that I feel really matches the mood of the environment and is easier to read than the default font set that was included with Fedora
