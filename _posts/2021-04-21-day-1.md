# Day 1
## Intro 
I decided to create a Jekyll blog to outline my journey through a programming skill reset. Over the last few months, I have been able to see gaps in my skillset due to being a self-taught developer. I hope that from starting from 0 I will be able to become stronger as a developer by picking up on things that I overlooked on my first go around. 

A little about me. I am a self-taught 33-year-old developer currently living in Costa Rica. I have been messing around with code in some capacity since the age of nine. Back in the early days, I would find an issue that I would want to tackle and I would hone in on fixing the said issue. The problem with this is that I got into the habit of adopting tunnel vision. I would be so focused on the solution that I would often miss taking more in from the journey. 

Now I am a bit older and wiser. I realize the effects that this has had on my approach to development and I would like to course-correct over the next two years. I realize that this is probably not the best way of going about this but this is the path I want to take. 
## Starting
My first order of business is getting this document off Google Docs and into GitHub pages.  I will be doing this by deploying [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Learning Paths
- I will be following this [guide](https://bit.ly/3x7bQxf) to get a Jekyll deployed and uploaded to [Github Pages](https://bit.ly/2QYeOU9)
- The excellent [Developers Roadmap](https://bit.ly/2QztM2R) which outlines a guide on how to become a full-stack developer
- Take the entire [Free Code Camp](https://bit.ly/3gyw3pw) curriculum for HTML, CSS, JS, and everything else under the sun
- Provide public links and repos for every project. I still havenâ€™t decided on how I am going to format this but I am sure it will come to me to further I am into the journey
## Now down to business
I Reformatted my workstation (DELL G3) and installed Fedora 33.

I bit the bullet and just wiped everything off the machine. Anything important is already in the cloud and to be honest, I need to get used to using the terminal in a meaningful way. Sure I will miss out on gaming (comfortably) but I can just save up for another machine that will serve that purpose in the future. In any case, steam exists for Linux and the only game I play regularly is DOTA.

Well, that was fairly easy...now I just need to get this configured for web development. First I am going to install ZSH with some styling and get NeoVim up and running. I want to try and avoid visual coding tools, for now, to build my terminal skills out while I am getting all the tools I need running. I got very used to using GitHub desktop while I was on windows and want to work exclusively with command-line tools for now.

For configuring my core development environment I found that the guide written by George Luiz Maluf and published by Fedora Magazine was especially helpful.  After some command fu (aka copy-pasting) I was up and running in no time!

I think that's enough for today. It took me a few hours to get this far into the build and going any further would probably lead to more problems I am not committed to resolving.  Thanks for reading.
