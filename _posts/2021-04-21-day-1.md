# The Journey Begins

I am a 33-year-old Costa Rican embarking on a journey of getting better at code. I decided to do a full reset to my skillset and start my journey from scratch. You see I have been self-taught all my life and I feel that there are gaps in standards and practices that I missed out on due to “winging” it most of my life. 

My first order of business is getting this document off of google docs and into GitHub pages. I will be following this guide ( https://bit.ly/3x7bQxf ) I will take on one project at a time and also take the entire Free Code Camp ( https://bit.ly/3gyw3pw ) curriculum for HTML, CSS,  and JS. 

Along the way, I am going to be adding links to the completed projects for the world to tear apart. I also need to find a way of formatting these posts so that it contains information that may be useful to others that may be embarking on a similar journey. 

Now down to business

I Reformatted my workstation (DELL G3) and installed Fedora 33.

I bit the bullet and just wiped everything off the machine. Anything that is important is already in the cloud and to be honest, I need to get used to using the terminal in a meaningful way. Sure I will miss out on gaming (comfortably) but I can just save up for another machine that will serve that purpose in the future. In any case, steam exists for Linux and the only game I play on a regular basis is DOTA.

Well, that was fairly easy...now I just need to get this configured for web development. First I am going to install ZSH with some styling and get NeoVim up and running. I want to try and avoid visual coding tools, for now, to build my terminal skills out while I am getting all the tools I need running. I got very used to using GitHub desktop while I was on windows and want to work exclusively with command-line tools for now.

For configuring my core development environment I found that the guide written by George Luiz Maluf and published by Fedora Magazine was especially helpful.  After some command fu (aka copy-pasting) I was up and running in no time!

Much better!
