# Day6 Production ready at last

My Friday was off to a great start. I had a game plan and different paths to take. I wanted to accomplish the following: 

- Integrate Bootstrap 5 into Jekyll
- Apply some sort of theme to the blog
- Get contact information added
- Start implementing some sort of responsive design 
- Apply a color palette 
- Change font
- Bootstrap icons
- Start using the google tag manager to track traffic 

Luckily after 8 long hours, I was able to accomplish that and had enough time to write this post. I have to say that last night was one of the longest in a while. Not only did I encounter issues every step of the way and to make matters worst I felt the growing pains of the Vim editor and Linux.

## Vim
Vim for all its capabilities is still very rigid for me. While I like the focus that it gives you at the time of entering code I do miss all the bells and whistles that [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offers. I have been using VScode for the last 5+ years and have made it my own. Given the issues that I ran into early on, I switched over to it after not being able to navigate as quickly as I would have liked. I was also tackling merging files from different repositories so I didn't want to get my inputs mixed up and make a mistake. To the Vim gods out there I ask that you be merciful ðŸ˜­

## Integrate Bootstrap 5 into Jekyll  + Start implementing some sort of responsive design + Apply a color palette + Change font
My first order of business was getting Bootstrap deployed in Jekyll. I followed the amazing [guide](https://betterprogramming.pub/an-introduction-to-using-jekyll-with-bootstrap-4-6f2433afeda9) outlined by   [Maria Schuessler](https://mariacodes.io/). I had a deployed instance already so I thought I would be cheeky and just merge in what I needed and prayed for the best. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that Jekyll version 4 did not play as nicely with Github Pages as I had hoped for. 

The issues started from early on when integrating the gem packages into the ``Gemfile`` . I learned that GithubPages is very particular about the versions that are used in the Gemfile and that they bundle most of what you need. One Gem in particular ``gem 'unf_ext', '~> 0.0.7.1'`` required me to install the [GCC-C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) library to even compile properly. I had to do tons of digging online but most of the support was for macOS and Windows. 

All that aside I decided to clone [Maria Schussler's repository](https://github.com/maltyeva/jekyll-bootstrap-starter) and merge the posts that I had made. It felt like cheating to be perfectly frank but I needed to get it out of the way to make any headway. After a few tweaks to the configuration file, I was finally able to get it to compile and run in my local environment. Little did I know that another headache was right around the corner...

Github has a build procedure that it follows for pages. In short, it must pass validation and build to update the site. While I was able to get it to work on my computer Github itself didn't pass the build and tossed me my first bug...

``Your SCSS file assets/css/main.scss has an error on line 6: File to import not found or unreadable: vendor/rfs. Load paths: assets/css /hoosegow/.bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/jekyll-theme-primer-0.5.4/_sass /hoosegow/.bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/jekyll-theme-primer-0.5.4/_sass /hoosegow/.bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/jekyll-theme-primer-0.5.4/_sass``

This put a damper on the mood, but it was a good test of patience to see this through. I was able to track down someone who was able to resolve this particular problem with an older version by modifying the ``.gitignore`` file by changing the ``vendor`` line to ``vendor/bundle`` it was able to upload and compile as normal. SCSS changes and all. 

## Apply some sort of theme to the blog

After resolving the build error I was able to start rocking and rolling. I enlisted the help of a close friend of mine to help settle on a pallet to use for the site. I wanted something easy on the eyes with emphasis on readability and impact. I have been using the Jetbrain Mono font on just about everything so I decided that I would use the thicker font variant for the site.

I enjoy how much it pops while making things like code more eligible. Since the background of the site was going to be darker I felt like it would be the right choice. The rest of this tale is just a matter of modifying the ``_variables`` SCSS file for bootstrap. I am leaving that for when I am further down the road with. 

## Get contact information added 
I used the icons that are packaged with bootstrap. I added some color for consistency and aggregated every form of text, audio, and video communication I could think of. I decided against adding my email address for now. Depending on what sort of traction (if any) these posts receive I may change my mind.

## Start using the google tag manager to track traffic 
I really should have set this up from the start but now is a good time as any. I was using bit.ly links earlier to do track because I figured I wasn't going to be doing much writing. But as I go deeper into this rabbit hole I realize that I want stats, and data. Knowledge is power after all! 

## In conclusion

Today I learned that there is a little piece of me that is always going to jump around. As much as I like the idea of this journey being linear I know that my nature is to do the opposite. I want to learn more and get better. The result of 8 hours of configurations, installations, and programming may seem somewhat fruitless to those more experienced but to me it's been such a worthwhile journey. Now with that all out of the way, I think the next steps are to take on the coding courses!
