# Day 2:: GIT && Jekyll&& Github pages

I wanted to find a solution that was free and offered a ton of documentation. After some thinking, I realized that way back when I had created a very basic page using GitHub Pages (2018) I went through my repositories and did a simple google search and found that they have expanded the service a bit since my heyday. Turns out that they offer a simpler method of deploying but for the sake of learning I decided to do it the old fashion way. 
## Getting started

The first thing I had to figure out was how to tackle setting up GIT via Linux and commit (no pun intended) to using the command line. I know that GitHub CLI is a thing now but I didn't want to rely on that just yet until I commit to muscle memory best practices.

## GIT

In Fedora, I started by running 

```
git config global.name enteryournamehere
git config global.email enteryouremailhere@email.com
```
Next, I checked to make sure that everything was saved correctly by running:: 

```
git config --list
```
Looks good! Moving on!

I followed the incredibly simple instructions on [GitHub pages](https://bit.ly/2QYeOU9) to get started. Essentially it was just creating a repository, setting it to public, and making sure to add github.io to the end and done! 

Now on to the good stuff getting Jekyll deployed :) 

## Jekyll

The [Jekyll guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) was easy enough to follow. I ran into issues with getting the live server to deploy due to a bug in version 3.0 of Ruby. I did some digging and I saw that there were already users that were reporting the same [issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523). I added the webrick to the gem file in the root directory and the live server was deployed. I did some digging and found some recommended extensions to use with Jekyll to make my life a little easier. I will list them down below :)

- [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://bit.ly/2PmnRO5)
- [Jekyll Site Map](https://bit.ly/3sOUG3V)

I will still need to do some more research on each one of these plugins to see how to properly implement them but in the meantime, I can begin publishing the blog!

The blog looks so basic for the time being but it at least gives me a place to publish my journey. I do have a web server that I can use but I wanted to start setting up some paradigms for different projects.

Oh, I almost forgot! I managed to write all of this in NeoVIM. Itâ€™s a stark contrast from using something like Visual Studio Code. But there is a certain distraction-free method about it all that I am loving. It's not making me any faster but it does keep me much more focused. I think that for the next post I want to refine my environment further by getting color themes, text completion, and maybe some shortcuts for GIT.
