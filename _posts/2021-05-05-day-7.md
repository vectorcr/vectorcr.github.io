# Developers roadmap (Internet)

The developer's roadmap is a highly curated and controlled set of tools that
outline paths to take to your desired skill set. Since I am focusing on the
frontend development path I am going to start with the first level which is

If you are interested in following along please go to the following [link](https://roadmap.sh).

You can also track the current chapter I am in by going [here](https://roadmap.sh/guides/what-is-internet)

## What is the internet?

Never did I think I would have to think about this seriously.
The internet for me is just a string of tools and services that I use daily for everything from research to social media. I never actually thought
about it as a complex system of computers talking to one another dishing out
requests at incredible speeds

While I was drilling down on this subject I came across an extremely helpful tool that allows you to
search within the Linux terminal. It made making searches and keeping in terminal a breeze. Below
are the links.

[wikit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wikit) This is a nodeJS app. You can use the `-q` variable
at your root directory to get it up and running (assuming that you have NodeJS installed on your
workstation. Full command `sudo npm install wikit -g`.

### Internet Protocol (IP)

When I started on this section I did not expect it to be as vast as it is. I had to be careful with not diving too deep into it because at that point I feel I would be going down towards networking. I don't doubt that I will be going down that path anyway but for the sake of staying on track, I want to just hone in on general concepts. If I go any further into IP addresses I will need to learn binary and quad notation. Something I feel is way out of scope for the time being.

### IPV4
- IP Addresses are 32 bit long
- IP addresses are divided into four sections of one byte each (octet)
- IP Addresses are typically written in dotted decimal format but can be represented in binary and hexadecimal

There are five classes for Ipv4

-Class A : 16,777,216 IP Addresses that can be assigned to hosts and the last number of assignable networks which are 126 by default.
-Class B: 65,534 and 16,384 assignable networks 
-Class C: 255 possible IP Address and 2,097,152 assignable networks 
-Class D: Multicast
-Class E: Research Purposes

### IPV6
- 128 bits
- 8 sections with 4 hexadecimal number : 2041:130f:0000:3f5d:0000:0000:875a:154b
- Leading 0's can be substituted by a double full colon : 2041:130f::3f5d::875a:154b


### DNS

DNS is the phonebook of the internet. Web browsers interact through IP address and DNS translates names to IP Addresses. Each device that is connecting to the internet has a unique address that other machines use to find the device. DNS eliminates the need for people to remember IP addresses and allows us to simply type google.com.

### Packets

Packets will travel from one way to another with different bits of data. Computer sending data will cut up larger amounts
of data into smaller pieces and send it through different routes and then be reassembled at its destination.

### Routing

Helps packets reach their destination

### TCP

TCP will do inventory and packets and send an acknowledgment of packets received.

## Site update (minor)

Decided to tone down the yellow text. After receiving some feedback I think its
best to lower the brightness for an easier reading experience overall.
