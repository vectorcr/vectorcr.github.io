# Developers roadmap (Internet)

The developers roadmap is a highly cureated and controlled set of tools that
outline paths to take to your desired skill set. Since I am focusing on the
frontend development path I am going to start with the first level which is

If you are interested in following along please go to the following [link](https://roadmap.sh).

of data into smaller pieces and send it through different routes and then be reassembled at its destination. 

### Fault Tolerance

### Routing 

Helps packets reach their destination 

### TCP

TCP will do inventory and packets and send an acknowledgement of packets received. 

### Reliability & Fault tolerance

### Scalable Solutions 

### HTML

Hyper Text Markup Language

### Audio, Photos, and Videos

All have unique addresses  

### HTTP

Hyper Text Transport Protocol

### POST Request

### Cookie Data

Usually a unique ID number
