# The final round of configurations

Last I wrote I thought I was done with the configuration phase of this project. That I had finally gotten to a point where I was comfortable and I had everything that I needed. While neovim has a lot of great features there is still just a lack of simple-to-follow documentation for some of the more complex plugins.

The learning curve when it comes to a Linux exclusive environment is something that has been a journey. I would say an uphill battle but to be perfectly honest everything that I needed windows for is so specific that it's more a lack of willpower rather than a lack of resources.
Something else interesting that happened was that Fedora 34 was released. 

It was a no-brainer at the moment to jump right into the newer version and just redo the config. I figured that it would be easier to start from scratch using all of the knowledge that I accumulated the first time around.

Alas…if things were that simple. You see the earlier workstation that I installed didn’t have to support the drivers for my GPU. I saw some solutions online but none that were reliable. I would attempt to plugin my secondary monitor and the entire computer would freeze. Needless to say, I learned my lesson about jumping to a new version without doing some research on the packages that I was running.

Luckily I had another workstation that was running nothing but intel software that was able to update to Fedora 34 with no problems. I ended up installing Fedora 33 on the G3 that had native support for the akmod Nvidia package. I decided to turn that workstation into a gaming box. While I was setting all that up I learned that there have been a few milestones hit by the proton team and that the list of support games has greatly increased since last I checked.
